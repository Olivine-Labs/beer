Arrow in the Mead & Amis
========================

![Arrow in the Mead](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Olivine-Labs/beer/master/blog/img/2014-07-09/mead.jpg)

On July 5th, we started our first batches: 5 gallons of Mead, which we've
dubbed "Arrow in the Mead", and 5 gallons of a German-American Pale Ale, named
Amis. (Amis was apparently German slang for "Americans" in World War 2,
according to a cursory Google search.)

Cleaning
--------

The first thing we had to do was [clean two *very* dirty carboys](https://github.com/Olivine-Labs/beer/issues/2)
that had plants growing in them.

I started off by dumping out the brackish water, refilling, and dumping. Took
about three fills to get the mud out.

We then soaked in oxyclean [as suggested by /r/homebrewing](http://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/28vwgl/clean_really_dirty_glass_carboys/)
to get the rest of the grit out.

Then we scrubbed, and scrubbed, and scrubbed more until we finally got the scum
from the edges of the carboys. Lo, sparkling glass:

That done, we invited a few friends and got going. We started around 10:30 and
ended around 7, just as the famous San Francisco fog was overtaking my yard.

The recipes were as follows:

Arrow in the Mead
-----------------

A basic honey mead.

5 Gallons. Expecting a 6-month fermentation period.

### Ingredients

* 15 lb clover honey
* 10 lb Hawaiian wildflower honey
* White Labs WLP720 "Sweet Mead" Yeast
* 5 gallons water (San Francisco tap water)
* 2.5 - 5 tsp Acid Blend (Used 2.5t; may increase to 5t later)
* 4 tsp Fermaid-K yeast nutrient (Used in increments)

### Procedure

(All units imperial: gallons, farenheit, and so on.)

1. Heated 5 gallons of water in a 7-gallon pot on a turkey fryer to a boil.
2. Added honey. (Note for next time: keep honey in warm water to soften.) Mix
  to dissolve in the hot water.
3. Cooled to 78 degrees.
4. Added 2.5t acid blend.
5. Added 1t Fermaid-K.
6. Pitched yeast. Measured gravity at 22.5 Brix.
7. Siphoned to carboy. Sat outside with an ambient temp of 68-72.
8. Moved to dark spot in garage. Fermented around 68-72 degrees.
9. Added 2t more Fermaid-K (for a total of 3) two days later, and aerated the
  mead by plunging with a carboy brush. Mead exploded out everywhere, made a
  mess. Be more gentle next time.

I plan on adding another 1t of Fermaid once the gravity drops to around 18.

We'll wait for one month and siphon into a new carboy in one month (8/5). Not
sure I can wait the whole six months for fermentation... it smells so good.

Amis
----

A German-American pale ale.

5 gallons. Expecting a 2-week fermentation period with an additional 2 weeks
carbonating in bottling.

### Ingredients

* 8.5 lb 2-row American Pale barley
* 1.5 lb German Munich barley
* 0.5 lb German Special Roast barley
* 0.5 lb Cora Pils barley
* 5 gallons water (should have gone 6.5 to reduce loss)
* 1 oz Tettnang hops
* 1 oz Cascade hops
* 1 oz Falconer's Flight hops
* White Labs WPL029 "German Kolsch" yeast

### Procedure

(All units imperial: gallons, farenheit, and so on.)

![Cooking](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Olivine-Labs/beer/master/blog/img/2014-07-09/cooking01.jpg)

1. Heated 5 gallons of water in a 7-gallon pot on a turkey fryer to a boil.
   (Note: next time use 6.5 so we don't have to add water later.)
2. Cooled to 165 degrees.
3. Added grain, which cooled water to 157 degrees.
4. Mashed between 157-163 for 40 minutes.
5. Removed from heat and scooped out grain (took about 25 minutes scooping it
  with a strainer.)
6. (Added 1 gallon water to replace evaporated liquid.)
7. Brought back to a boil. Added 1 oz Tettnang hops once boiling.
9. At half an hour, added 0.5 oz Cascade hops. (Whoops, meant to wait 50
  minutes.)
9. At 50 minutes, added another 0.5 oz Cascade hops. (Should have been at 55,
  if we did the previous hops at 50.)
10. Added 1 oz Falconer's hops at one hour and removed from heat, placed in ice bath.
  ![Cooling](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Olivine-Labs/beer/master/blog/img/2014-07-09/cooling.jpg)
11. Once cooled to 75 degrees, removed from ice bath and added vial of German
  Kolsch yeast.
12. Measured gravity at 13 Brix.
13. Primary fermentation at 68-72 degrees (yeast activity brought up to 74,
  then quieted down by the fourth day.)
