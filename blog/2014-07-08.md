Cleaning the Carboys
====================

The first thing we had to do was [clean two *very* dirty carboys](https://github.com/Olivine-Labs/beer/issues/2)
that had plants growing in them.

I started off by dumping out the brackish water, refilling, and dumping. Took
about three fills to get the mud out.

We then soaked in oxyclean [as suggested by /r/homebrewing](http://www.reddit.com/r/Homebrewing/comments/28vwgl/clean_really_dirty_glass_carboys/)
to get the rest of the grit out.

Then we scrubbed, and scrubbed, and scrubbed more until we finally got the scum
from the edges of the carboys. Lo, sparkling glass:
