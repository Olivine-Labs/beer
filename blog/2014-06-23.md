In The Beginning
================

[Drew](https://github.com/doriangray) and [I](https://github.com/ajacksified)
have been talking about homebrewing in our basement for a while; he has
experience, and I've read a book about it once. This shall chronicle our
efforts in producing fermented (and hopefully delicious) consumables.

We're open-sourcing and blogging as much of our efforts as we can, from
equipment to recipes and procedures, because I'm curious what running a
homebrewing operation like a software operation would be like. And also
because Drew's the master brewer, not me.
